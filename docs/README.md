# M&A Technical Discovery Script - AD Audit Toolkit

**Author**: Adrian Johnson <adrian207@gmail.com>

## The Solution

This PowerShell toolkit eliminates blind spots in Microsoft infrastructure acquisitions by automatically inventorying 300+ critical configuration points across Active Directory, Microsoft 365, and SQL Server environments—delivering actionable migration plans, cost estimates, and security risk assessments in hours instead of weeks.

**Bottom Line**: Reduce M&A technical due diligence from 2-4 weeks of manual discovery to 2-8 hours of automated data collection, with higher accuracy and zero missed blockers.

---

## Why This Matters

**Situation**: Companies acquiring Microsoft-based organizations face 60+ days to complete tenant-to-tenant migrations, with costs ranging from $500K to $5M+.

**Problem**: Traditional discovery methods miss critical blockers—end-of-life SQL servers, orphaned applications, hidden security vulnerabilities, and undocumented dependencies—causing migration delays, budget overruns, and failed integrations.

**What You Get**: Three deliverables that immediately reduce risk:

1. **Migration Blocker Analysis** - Identifies 18 categories of critical blockers (public folders, shared Teams channels, on-prem gateways, end-of-life systems) with severity ratings and remediation requirements
2. **Financial Impact Assessment** - Quantifies infrastructure costs including SQL Server licensing ($15K/core), Azure SQL migration costs ($3K-$10K/month per database), and license reconciliation opportunities
3. **Security Posture Report** - Exposes privilege escalation paths, ACL misconfigurations, stale accounts, and compliance gaps requiring immediate remediation

## What Gets Audited (300+ Data Points)

### Infrastructure & Identity (85 data points)
Reveals technical debt, security gaps, and migration dependencies in your identity foundation:
- **Active Directory**: 25K+ users, privileged accounts, ACL misconfigurations, password policies, Kerberos delegation risks
- **Hybrid Identity**: ADFS configurations, AD Connect sync rules, authentication method (PHS/PTA/Federated)
- **Entra ID**: Cloud users, Conditional Access policies, PIM adoption rates, MFA coverage gaps, legacy authentication usage

### Server & Database Estate (120 data points)
Quantifies infrastructure modernization requirements and cloud migration costs:
- **Server Hardware**: CPU/memory/storage across 500+ servers, virtualization distribution, end-of-life OS detection (Server 2012 R2)
- **Installed Applications**: Top 10 applications by prevalence, SQL Server editions (Express/Standard/Enterprise), IIS, Exchange, SharePoint
- **SQL Server Databases**: Database sizes totaling 15TB+, backup status (7-day gaps flagged), Always On Availability Groups, linked servers to external orgs (blockers)
- **SQL Server Security**: Logins with sysadmin, SQL Agent jobs with external dependencies, orphaned logins, TDE encryption status
- **Event Logs & Access**: Top 10 critical/error events per server, current user sessions, 90-day logon history with frequency analysis

### Microsoft 365 Workloads (75 data points)
Scopes collaboration platform migration complexity and data volumes:
- **Exchange Online**: 5,000 mailboxes totaling 2TB, public folders (migration blocker), litigation holds, forwarding rules to external domains
- **SharePoint & Teams**: 500 sites consuming 10TB, SharePoint 2010/2013 workflows (deprecated blockers), private/shared channels, anonymous sharing links
- **Power Platform**: Environments with Dataverse, apps using on-prem data gateways (cannot migrate), premium connectors (licensing impact), flows with hardcoded URLs

### Security & Compliance (20 data points)
Maps regulatory requirements and data protection controls:
- **Data Governance**: Retention policies, sensitivity labels with encryption, DLP policies, eDiscovery holds
- **Access Controls**: Conditional Access policy coverage, information barriers, privileged role assignments

## How It Works

### Three-Phase Approach

**Phase 1: Automated Discovery** (2-8 hours)
The toolkit connects to your environment using read-only credentials and executes 8 parallel audit modules, each querying specific APIs and management interfaces without modifying any data.

**Phase 2: Data Validation** (automatic)
Built-in quality checks validate collected data (e.g., "0 users found" triggers permission error flag), calculate a data quality score (0-100%), and flag suspicious results requiring manual review.

**Phase 3: Report Generation** (automatic)
Consolidates findings into executive dashboards (HTML) and detailed datasets (60+ CSV files), with AES-256 encryption applied to all output for secure chain of custody.

### Modular Architecture

Eight independent modules enable flexible execution—run all modules for comprehensive assessment, or execute specific modules when access is limited:

```
Invoke-AD-Audit.ps1              → On-premises identity, servers, SQL databases
Invoke-HybridIdentity-Audit.ps1  → ADFS, AD Connect, authentication methods  
Invoke-EntraID-Audit.ps1         → Cloud identity, Conditional Access, devices
Invoke-Exchange-Audit.ps1        → Mailboxes, public folders, transport rules
Invoke-SPO-Teams-Audit.ps1       → SharePoint sites, Teams, M365 Groups
Invoke-PowerPlatform-Audit.ps1   → Power Apps, Flows, Dataverse, gateways
Invoke-Compliance-Audit.ps1      → DLP, retention, eDiscovery, sensitivity labels
Invoke-Network-Audit.ps1         → DNS zones, DHCP scopes, AD sites
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites (One-Time Setup)

**Required Permissions** (read-only access only):
- Active Directory: Domain User + Local Administrator on servers (for hardware inventory and SQL queries)
- Microsoft 365: Global Reader or combination of Exchange/SharePoint/Teams/Compliance Administrator (read-only roles)
- SQL Server: VIEW SERVER STATE and VIEW ANY DEFINITION (or db_datareader on system databases)

**PowerShell Modules** (auto-install on first run):
```powershell
Install-Module ActiveDirectory, Microsoft.Graph, ExchangeOnlineManagement, 
               PnP.PowerShell, MicrosoftTeams, 
               Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell
```

### Quick Start (3 Commands)

**Full audit with recommended settings**:
```powershell
.\Run-M&A-Audit.ps1 `
    -CompanyName "Contoso" `
    -ADCredential (Get-Credential) `
    -OutputFolder "C:\Audits\Contoso" `
    -ServerEventLogDays 30 `
    -ServerLogonHistoryDays 90 `
    -Verbose
```

**Fast audit (skip time-intensive event log analysis)**:
```powershell
.\Run-M&A-Audit.ps1 `
    -CompanyName "Contoso" `
    -ADCredential (Get-Credential) `
    -OutputFolder "C:\Audits\Contoso" `
    -SkipEventLogs `
    -SkipLogonHistory `
    -Verbose
```

**Cloud-only audit (no Active Directory access)**:
```powershell
.\Run-M&A-Audit.ps1 `
    -CompanyName "Contoso" `
    -SkipAD `
    -OutputFolder "C:\Audits\Contoso" `
    -Verbose
```

### Execution Times

| Environment Size | Users | Servers | Time | Critical Factor |
|-----------------|-------|---------|------|-----------------|
| Small | <500 | <25 | 30-60 min | Event logs add 15-20 min |
| Medium | 500-5K | 25-100 | 2-4 hours | SQL inventory adds 30-60 min |
| Large | 5K-25K | 100-500 | 6-10 hours | Use `-MaxParallelServers 20` |
| Enterprise | 25K+ | 500+ | 12-24 hours | Run modules separately if needed |

**Performance optimization**: Set `-MaxParallelServers 20` (queries 20 servers simultaneously), skip event logs with `-SkipEventLogs` if time is constrained, and ensure WinRM is enabled on all servers before starting.

## Configuration Options

### Server Inventory Parameters

Control the depth and performance of server data collection:

```powershell
-ServerEventLogDays 30            # Event log history (7/30/60/90 days)
-ServerLogonHistoryDays 90        # Logon analysis timeframe (30/60/90/180/365 days)
-MaxParallelServers 10            # Concurrent server queries (1-50, default: 10)
-ServerQueryTimeout 300           # Timeout per server in seconds (default: 5 min)
-SkipEventLogs                    # Exclude event logs (saves 30-50% execution time)
-SkipLogonHistory                 # Exclude logon history (saves 20-30% time)
-IncludeServerServices            # Include Windows services (verbose, default: off)
```

### Module Selection Parameters

Run specific modules when full access is unavailable:

```powershell
-OnlyAD                           # AD and servers only (fastest, 30-90 min)
-SkipAD                           # Cloud-only audit (for cloud-first orgs)
-SkipSQL                          # Skip SQL inventory (if no SQL Server present)
-SkipPowerPlatform                # Skip Power Platform (often requires elevated admin)
```

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection

**What we collect**: Configuration data, object inventories, metadata only—no passwords, email content, or document data.

**How we protect it**: 
- AES-256 encryption on all output files (rest)
- TLS 1.2+ for all API communications (transit)
- Output folder permissions restricted to audit runner (Windows ACLs)
- audit_metadata.json tracks execution chain of custody (who, when, from where)

**Retention guidance**: 90-day retention recommended, then secure deletion (7-pass wipe or crypto-shredding).

### Read-Only Operations

Every PowerShell cmdlet is read-only (`Get-*`, `Read-*`)—zero `Set-*`, `Remove-*`, or `New-*` cmdlets used. Pre-flight permission checks validate access before execution and exit gracefully if write permissions are detected.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues (3 Failure Modes)

**"Access Denied" on servers** → Solution: Verify Local Administrator membership or add audit account to `Builtin\Administrators` group on target servers. Enable WinRM: `Enable-PSRemoting -Force`.

**Event log queries timeout** → Solution: Reduce `-ServerEventLogDays` to 7 days, or use `-SkipEventLogs` flag. Servers with 1GB+ Security logs require 5-10 minutes per server.

**Graph API throttling errors** → Solution: Script includes exponential backoff retry (automatic). For large tenants (25K+ users), run modules separately to stay under throttling limits (2,000 requests per 10 seconds per app).

### Validation Failures

**Data Quality Score <70%** indicates collection issues:
- Score 90-100%: Excellent, all modules successful
- Score 70-89%: Good, minor gaps (e.g., some offline servers)
- Score 50-69%: Fair, module failures or permission gaps—review `errors.log`
- Score <50%: Poor, significant collection failures—verify credentials and permissions

Check `Output/[Timestamp]/Logs/errors.log` for detailed failure reasons and affected modules.
