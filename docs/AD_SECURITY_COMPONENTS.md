## Security Components

### 1. ACL Analysis (`Get-ACLAnalysis`)

**Purpose**: Analyzes NTFS permissions and dangerous Access Control Entries (ACEs) in Active Directory.

#### What It Does:
- Analyzes ACLs on critical AD containers
- Detects dangerous permissions (GenericAll, WriteDACL, WriteOwner)
- Identifies excessive rights granted to Everyone/Anonymous/Authenticated Users
- Flags non-standard explicit permissions

#### Critical Paths Analyzed:
- Domain root
- AdminSDHolder container
- Domain Controllers OU
- Users container
- Computers container

#### Output:
- **File**: `AD_ACL_Issues.csv`
- **Columns**: Path, Identity, Rights, AccessControlType, IsInherited, Reason, Severity

#### Risk Levels:
- **Critical**: Everyone/Anonymous with dangerous rights
- **High**: Non-standard explicit dangerous permissions
- **Medium**: Authenticated Users with excessive rights

#### Example Issues Detected:
- Everyone with GenericAll on domain root
- Non-admin accounts with WriteDACL permissions
- Unexpected explicit permissions on AdminSDHolder

---

### 2. Kerberos Delegation Detection (`Get-KerberosDelegation`)

**Purpose**: Detects accounts configured for Kerberos delegation (unconstrained and constrained).

#### What It Does:
- Identifies computers with unconstrained delegation (excluding DCs)
- Identifies user accounts with unconstrained delegation
- Identifies accounts with constrained delegation
- Lists allowed delegation targets for constrained delegation

#### Output Files:
- **File**: `AD_Kerberos_Delegation.csv`
- **Columns**: ObjectType, Name, SAMAccountName, DelegationType, ServicePrincipalNames, AllowedToDelegateTo, OperatingSystem, DistinguishedName, Severity, Recommendation

#### Risk Assessment:
- **Unconstrained Delegation (Critical)**: High risk - account can impersonate any user
- **Constrained Delegation (Medium)**: Lower risk - limited to specific services

#### Security Recommendations:
- Remove unconstrained delegation where possible
- Use resource-based constrained delegation (RBCD) instead
- Review service accounts with delegation rights
- Ensure no user accounts have unconstrained delegation

---

### 3. DHCP Scope Analysis (`Get-DHCPScopeAnalysis`)

**Purpose**: Analyzes DHCP servers, scopes, and lease utilization.

#### What It Does:
- Discovers DHCP servers authorized in AD
- Collects scope configurations (IP ranges, subnet masks, lease duration)
- Analyzes scope utilization (addresses in use, free, percentage)
- Samples active leases (up to 100 per scope)

#### Output Files:
1. **`AD_DHCP_Servers.csv`**
   - Columns: ServerName, IPAddress, Status

2. **`AD_DHCP_Scopes.csv`**

- Tracks version numbers (user and computer)

#### Output:
- **File**: `AD_GPO_Inventory.csv`
- **Columns**: DisplayName, Id, GpoStatus, CreationTime, ModificationTime, UserVersion, ComputerVersion, WmiFilterName, LinksCount, LinkedOUs, Owner

#### Analysis Opportunities:
- Identify orphaned GPOs (no links)
- Find stale GPOs (no recent modifications)
- Review GPO ownership
- Audit WMI filter usage
- Detect conflicting policies

---

### 5. Service Account Analysis (`Get-ServiceAccounts`)

**Purpose**: Identifies service accounts and analyzes their security posture.

#### What It Does:
- Finds accounts with Service Principal Names (SPNs)
- Analyzes password age and expiration settings
- Identifies privileged service accounts (AdminCount = 1)
- Calculates security risk scores
- Tracks last logon dates

#### Output:
- **File**: `AD_Service_Accounts.csv`
- **Columns**: Name, SAMAccountName, Enabled, ServicePrincipalNames, PasswordLastSet, PasswordAgeDays, PasswordNeverExpires, LastLogon, IsPrivileged, DistinguishedName, SecurityRisk

#### Risk Scoring:
- **High Risk**: Password never expires OR password age > 180 days
- **Medium Risk**: Password age > 90 days
- **Low Risk**: Password age ≤ 90 days

#### Security Recommendations:
- Implement password rotation for service accounts
- Use Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs) where possible

- Identifies trust types (external, forest, shortcut)
- Checks security settings (SID filtering, selective authentication)
- Reviews forest transitivity

#### Output:
- **File**: `AD_Trusts.csv`
- **Columns**: Name, Direction, TrustType, TrustAttributes, Source, Target, ForestTransitive, SelectiveAuthentication, SIDFilteringEnabled, Created, Modified, SecurityLevel

#### Security Levels:
- **Review Required**: Bidirectional trust without selective authentication
- **Normal**: Trusts with appropriate security controls

#### Security Considerations:
- Bidirectional trusts increase attack surface
- SID filtering should be enabled for external trusts
- Selective authentication limits trust scope
- Forest trusts are transitive by nature

---

### 7. Password Policies (`Get-PasswordPolicies`)

**Purpose**: Analyzes domain and fine-grained password policies.

#### What It Does:

## Integration with Main Audit

All 9 components are automatically executed during the AD audit phase:

```powershell
.\Run-M&A-Audit.ps1 -CompanyName "Contoso" -OutputFolder "C:\Audits"
```

**Execution Order**:
1. Forest/Domain info
2. User inventory
3. Computer inventory
4. Group inventory
5. Privileged accounts
6. **Advanced AD Security Components** ← All 9 functions
7. Server inventory (if enabled)
8. SQL inventory (if enabled)

---

## Error Handling

All components implement graceful error handling:

- **Module Dependencies**: Functions check for required modules (GroupPolicy, DHCP, DNS)
- **Permissions**: Functions gracefully handle access denied errors
- **Availability**: Functions handle missing features (e.g., no DHCP servers, no Certificate Services)
- **Logging**: All errors logged to audit log with severity levels

### Common Scenarios:
- **No DHCP servers**: Returns null, logs informational message
- **No Certificate Services**: Returns null, logs informational message
- **GroupPolicy module missing**: Returns null, logs error with required module name
- **Access denied on ACLs**: Logs warning, continues with accessible objects

---

## Performance Considerations

### Execution Times (estimates):
- ACL Analysis: ~30 seconds (5 critical paths)
- Kerberos Delegation: ~15 seconds
- DHCP Analysis: ~1-2 minutes (depends on lease count)
- GPO Inventory: ~30 seconds - 2 minutes (depends on GPO count)
- Service Accounts: ~20 seconds
- AD Trusts: ~5 seconds
- Password Policies: ~5 seconds
- DNS Zones: ~1-2 minutes (depends on zone/record count)
- Certificate Services: ~10 seconds

**Total Additional Time**: ~5-10 minutes for all 9 components

### Optimization:
- DNS records limited to first 100 per zone
- DHCP leases limited to first 100 per scope
- Parallel processing not used (sequential execution for stability)
