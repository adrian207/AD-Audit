  - Microsoft Entra ID
  - Exchange Online
  - SharePoint & Teams Audit
  - Power Platform Audit
  - Compliance & Security Audit

[12:00:00] Starting Active Directory audit...
[12:05:00] Collecting user inventory... 2,143 users found
[12:10:00] Collecting server inventory... 58 servers found
...
```

**⏱️ Execution Time Estimates:**
- **Small** (< 200 users, < 20 servers): 15-30 minutes
- **Medium** (200-1,000 users, 20-100 servers): 30-90 minutes
- **Large** (> 1,000 users, > 100 servers): 1-3 hours

## Step 5: Review the Reports (30 seconds)

When complete, the **Executive Summary** report will automatically open in your default browser.

### 📊 **Executive Summary** (Boardroom-Ready)
- Migration readiness score
- Key metrics (users, servers, mailboxes, Teams)
- Risk indicators (stale accounts, backup issues, privileged accounts)
- Top findings and recommendations

### 🔍 **Detailed Reports** (Technical Drill-Down)
Click the navigation menu for:
- **Active Directory**: Stale users, OS distribution, GPOs, trusts, DNS zones
- **Server Infrastructure**: Hardware inventory, storage, top applications
- **SQL Databases**: Instance details, backup issues, logins, failed jobs
- **Security Analysis**: Privileged accounts, service accounts, best practices

---

## Next Steps

### **Immediate (Day 1)**
1. ✅ Review Executive Summary with stakeholders
2. ✅ Identify high-priority risks (backup failures, privileged accounts)
3. ✅ Share reports with technical teams for validation

### **Short Term (Week 1)**
1. 📋 Deep-dive into raw CSV data files (`Output\RawData\`)
2. 🔍 Cross-reference findings with business requirements
3. 📊 Build migration project plan based on discovered infrastructure

### **Medium Term (Month 1)**
1. 🚀 Begin remediation of identified issues
2. 🔄 Re-run audit to validate improvements
3. 📈 Track metrics over time

## Common First-Run Issues

### ❌ **"Cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"**
**Solution**: Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### ❌ **"Access Denied" when collecting server data**
**Solution**: Ensure you're running as a **Domain Admin** account.

### ❌ **Cloud modules fail to connect**
**Solution**: You'll be prompted to authenticate. Use an account with **Global Reader** role.

### ❌ **GUI doesn't launch**
**Solution**: You may be missing .NET Framework 4.5+. Install from Microsoft.

### ❌ **Execution is very slow**
**Solution**: Reduce parallelism in GUI: **Max Parallel Servers** = `5` (default is 10)
