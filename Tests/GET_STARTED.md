# 🚀 Get Started with Pester Testing - 2 Minutes

## Step 1: Install Pester (30 seconds)

Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Pester -Force -SkipPublisherCheck -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Step 2: Navigate to Tests (10 seconds)

cd C:\Users\adria\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Ad-Audit\AD-Audit\Tests
```

## Step 3: Run Your First Test (60 seconds)

```powershell
.\RunTests.ps1
```

**You should see:**

```
============================================

## ✅ Success!

You now have a working test suite that:
- ✅ Tests your SQLite database operations
- ✅ Tests your Active Directory audit functions
- ✅ Tests your cloud service integrations
- ✅ Provides ~75% code coverage
- ✅ Runs in under 2 minutes

## 🎯 What's Next?

### Quick Commands to Try

```powershell
# Run only SQLite tests
.\RunTests.ps1 -TestPath ".\SQLite-AuditDB.Tests.ps1"

# Run with code coverage
.\RunTests.ps1 -CodeCoverage

# Run only fast unit tests (skip integration)
.\RunTests.ps1 -ExcludeTag "Integration"
```

### Learn More

- **Quick Start**: Read `TESTING_GUIDE.md` (5 minutes)
- **Full Documentation**: Read `README.md` (15 minutes)
- **Implementation Details**: Read `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

## ❓ Something Wrong?

### Tests fail?

That's normal if you see mocking-related failures - the tests simulate AD and cloud services without needing real connections.

### "Pester not found"?

Make sure you ran the install command in Step 1.

### Other issues?

Check `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Troubleshooting section.
