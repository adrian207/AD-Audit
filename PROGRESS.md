## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Parallel Processing**: Uses `ForEach-Object -ThrottleLimit` for speed (5-50 concurrent operations)
2. **CIM over WMI**: CIM sessions for better performance and compatibility
3. **Graceful Failure**: Offline servers and unreachable SQL instances don't halt execution
4. **CSV Export**: All raw data preserved for custom analysis (25+ CSV files)
5. **Modular Design**: Each function independent, testable, can be run standalone
6. **Minto Pyramid**: Documentation follows answer-first principle
7. **ADO.NET SqlClient**: Native .NET for SQL queries (no SQLPS module dependency)
8. **Concurrent Collections**: Thread-safe bags for parallel processing results

---

**Current Status**: ✅ **Phase 2 COMPLETE! Production-ready for comprehensive AD + Server + SQL inventory**.

**Ready to Deploy**: This tool delivers **complete on-premises discovery** for M&A due diligence. Use it TODAY on any Windows/AD environment for instant infrastructure visibility.

**What's Next**: Phase 3 (M365 cloud workloads) or HTML reporting.
